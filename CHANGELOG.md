and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.1.0] - 2025-08-16

### 🔧 Fixed - Jina Search Engine Configuration
- **Jina API Key Requirement**: Fixed issue where Jina search engine was displayed as available even without API key
- **Proper Engine Filtering**: Jina engine is now only initialized when API key is provided
- **Accurate Status Reporting**: Engine status now correctly reflects API key availability
- **Enhanced Engine Status**: Added `has_api_key` and `features` fields to engine status information
- **Improved Configuration Logic**: Updated configuration manager to properly handle Jina engine enablement

### 🔧 Technical Improvements
- Updated `JinaSearch.is_available()` to check for API key presence
- Fixed `ConfigManager.is_engine_enabled()` to require API key for Jina engine
- Enhanced `SearchManager._initialize_engines()` with proper conditional initialization
- Added detailed engine status information with API key validation
- Improved error handling and logging for engine initialization

### 📚 Documentation
- Updated README.md to reflect Jina API key requirement (changed from "Optional" to "API key")
- Updated README_zh.md with correct Jina configuration information
- Clarified API key requirements across all documentation

### 🧪 Testing
- Verified engine behavior with and without API keys
- Tested engine availability reporting accuracy
- Validated proper failover behavior when engines are unavailable

## [2.0.0] - 2025-08-16

### 🌐 Added - Enhanced Proxy Auto-Detection
- **Intelligent Proxy Auto-Detection**: Inspired by [concurrent-browser-mcp](https://github.com/sailaoda/concurrent-browser-mcp)
- **Three-Layer Detection Strategy**: Environment variables → Port scanning → System proxy detection
- **Zero Configuration**: Automatic proxy detection without manual setup
- **Socket-Based Port Scanning**: Tests 7 common proxy ports (7890, 1087, 8080, 3128, 8888, 10809, 20171)
- **macOS System Proxy Support**: Detects system proxy settings via `networksetup` command
- **Smart Priority Handling**: Environment variables take precedence over auto-detection
- **3-Second Timeout**: Efficient connection testing with reasonable timeout
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed proxy detection logs for debugging

### 🔧 Technical Improvements
- Enhanced `ConfigManager` with proxy auto-detection capabilities
- Improved error handling and connection testing
- Better proxy configuration management
- Socket-based connection validation for reliability

### 📚 Documentation
- Updated README.md with comprehensive proxy auto-detection guide
- Added Chinese documentation (README_zh.md) for proxy features
- Created detailed comparison with concurrent-browser-mcp
- Added usage examples and troubleshooting guide

### 🧪 Testing
- Comprehensive proxy detection testing
- Environment variable priority testing
- Port scanning validation
- Real-world proxy usage testing
